# User Data CRUD operation application

# Introduction

A list of the users and their details received from the API is displayed. This is a basic CRUD application that allows the end user to Create new users, Read, Update or Delete the details of an existing user.
These operations can be performed by the clicking on the respective interactive buttons.
The green â€˜Add Userâ€™ button at the bottom of the page allows to create new users. The red â€˜deleteâ€™ button at the end of each row corresponding to each user allows to delete that particular user. The button in the edit column for each user allows to edit the details of the corresponding user.
All the changes take place in the local state.

# Setup

Run this command in terminal to get the necessary packages (node_modules folder is not included but running npm i will install the necessary packages )

## `npm i`

Directory structure is:

ðŸ“¦src
 â”£ ðŸ“‚components
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œFetchUser.jsx
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œForm.jsx
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œTable.jsx
 â”£ ðŸ“œApp.css
 â”£ ðŸ“œApp.js
 â”£ ðŸ“œApp.test.js
 â”£ ðŸ“œindex.css
 â”£ ðŸ“œindex.js
 â”£ ðŸ“œlogo.svg
 â”£ ðŸ“œreportWebVitals.js
 â”— ðŸ“œsetupTests.js
The App.js file calls the FetchUser.jsx which is inside the components folder. The render() inside the FetchUser.jsx calls the files Table.jsx and Form.jsx.

The application supports CRUD operation. The UI has Add User button to create a new user which opens a form to submit the user details. The Edit icon on each row is used to update any existing information about the user. The delete button deletes the user from the table. 

# To Run the application

Go to the main directory and execute `npm start` and the application opens up at the address -  http://localhost:3000/  automatically.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
